🎯 Why I Built This:
As part of my journey in learning React, I wanted to build something practical and resume-worthy. This project showcases my ability to:

1) Use React Hooks for managing component state

2) Create reusable components

3) Handle form submissions and validations

4) Implement persistent client-side storage

🧩 Ideal for students, developers, and professionals looking to manage their job applications efficiently.

🌱 Future Enhancements:
1) 🔍 Add search & filter functionality

2) 🗂️ Categorize jobs by status (e.g., Interviewed, Rejected, Pending)

3) 🔒 Add user authentication and backend support (Firebase, Supabase, Node.js)

4) 📱 Make it fully responsive for all screen sizes
